/**
 * The basket as the *screens* read it, not as the platform sends it.
 *
 * These shapes outlived the legacy API on purpose. A dozen templates bind to
 * `items[].name`, `items[].price` and `total.price`, and the platform's cart
 * carries none of them — it is lines, quantities and a version, with no money
 * at all. `UiCartService` assembles this projection from the cart, the menu and
 * the pricing call, so the templates did not have to be rewritten alongside
 * every service.
 *
 * Several members below are therefore filled with zero or empty rather than a
 * number the platform computed: `packaging` and `promo_code` have no platform
 * equivalent at all, `delivery` is priced by its own endpoint against a
 * destination (ADR 0037), and `vendor` is a legacy block with nothing behind it.
 * They are kept so the templates compile and are documented here so nobody
 * reads a zero as a fact.
